We provide the arguments for running various steps of CellNEST model along with the preferred values as Default. Most of the arguments are self-explanatory. The parameters that may need changing are discussed. 

## Data Preprocess 
Sample command:
```
cellnest preprocess --data_name='V1_Human_Lymph_Node_spatial' --data_from='data/V1_Human_Lymph_Node_spatial/'
```
### Arguments
    --data_name = Name of the dataset. Type is String. Required
    --data_from = Path to the dataset to read from. Space Ranger outs/ folder is preferred. Otherwise, provide the *.mtx file of the gene expression matrix. Type is String. Required.
    --data_to = Path to save the input graph (to be passed to GAT). Type is String. Default = 'input_graph/'.
    --metadata_to = Path to save the metadata. Type is String. Default='metadata/'
    --filter_min_cell = Minimum number of cells for gene filtering. Type is Int. Default=1. 
    --threshold_gene_exp = Threshold percentile for gene expression. Genes above this percentile are considered active. Type is float. Default=98
    --tissue_position_file = If your --data_from argument points to a *.mtx file instead of Space Ranger, then please provide the path to tissue position file. Type is String. Default='None'
    --spot_diameter = Spot/cell diameter for filtering ligand-receptor pairs based on cell-cell contact information. Should be provided in the same unit as spatia data (for Visium, that is pixel). Type is float. Default=89.43
    --split = How many split sections? Type is Int. Default=0. 
    --neighborhood_threshold = Set neighborhood threshold distance in terms of same unit as spot diameter. Type is float. If not set, then it is set to four times of the spot diameter.
    --database_path = Provide your desired ligand-receptor database path here. Default database is a combination of CellChat and NicheNet database. Type is String. Default='database/NEST_database.csv'

Varying --filter_min_cell does not bring a big change in the output, and we recommend using a higher value for it to reduce GPU memory consumption. --threshold_gene_exp is a crucial parameter, and we recommend keeping it around 98%. Making it too low will result in too big input graph and may not fit in the GPU. On the other hand, keeping it too high causes the risk of losing important genes. --spot_diameter is set for Visium Spatial Transcriptomics data. If other data format is used, please see the vignette for details. All other parameters can be kept at the default setting unless special circumstances arise, like splitting the input graph using --split to accommodate a very large input dataset.


We have the following optional arguments for integrating intracellular pathways with the ligand-receptor coexpression and recommend keeping the parameters at their default values:
### Arguments for integrating intracellular signaling with inter-cellular signals
    --intra_database_path = Provide your desired ligand-receptor database path here. Default database is a postprocessed NicheNet database as explained in the paper. Type is String. Default='database/nichenet_pathways_NEST.csv'. 
    --add_intra = Set it to 1 for intracellular signaling pathway. Type is Int. Default=1
    --num_hops = Maximum number of hops for intracellular signaling pathway search. Type is Int. Default=10
    --threshold_gene_exp_intra = Threshold percentile for gene expression. Genes above this percentile are considered active. This should be kept very low to detect most of the intracellular signals. Type is float. Default=20%

    --output_all = Set it to 1 to output all communications. Type is Int. Default=-1
    
By default top 20% (--top_percent=20) CCC are kept, and the rest are discarded as most of the true connections are detected within top 20% based on synthetic data. Increasing this value will result in a lot of false positives. If you want to filter based on median absolute deviation (MAD) or z scores (1.97), please use --cutoff_MAD=1 or --cutoff_z_score=1, respectively.
